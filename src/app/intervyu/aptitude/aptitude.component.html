<h1>APTITUDE</h1>
<p>Aptitude refers to a person's natural ability or talent in a particular area. It's often seen as an innate quality
    rather than something that's learned or acquired through experience.</p>
<h2>Why Aptitude Tests are Used in Job Assessments:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Predictive of Job Performance :</strong> Studies have shown that aptitude tests can be a good
        predictor of future job performance. They can help identify individuals who have the natural abilities needed to
        succeed in specific roles.</li>
    <li><strong>Fair and Objective :</strong> Aptitude tests are generally considered to be fair and objective
        measures of ability. They can help to eliminate biases based on factors like education, experience, or
        background.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost-Effective :</strong> Compared to other assessment methods like interviews or reference
        checks, aptitude tests can be relatively cost-effective.</li>
    <li><strong>Standardized :</strong> Many aptitude tests are standardized, which means that they are
        administered and scored in a consistent manner, making it easier to compare results across different
        candidates.</li>
    <li><strong>Focus on Potential :</strong> Aptitude tests focus on a candidate's potential rather than their
        past achievements. This can be particularly useful for identifying individuals with high potential who may not
        have had many opportunities to demonstrate their skills.</li>
