<h1>TECHNICAL INTERVIEW ROUND : A Deep Dive</h1>
<p>The technical interview is a crucial stage in the job application process, particularly for roles in

    technology and engineering fields. It's designed to assess a candidate's technical proficiency, problem-
    solving abilities, and coding skills.</p>

<h3>The Technical Interview Process</h3>
<p>Typically, a technical interview involves one or more of the following:</p>
<h4>1. Coding Round</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Problem-Solving :</strong> Candidates are presented with coding challenges, often in a
        coding environment like LeetCode or HackerRank.</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithm and Data Structure Knowledge :</strong> The ability to design efficient algorithms
        and choose appropriate data structures is paramount.</li>
    <li><strong>Coding Skills :</strong> Clean, efficient, and well-commented code is highly valued.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. System Design Round</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>System Design :</strong> Candidates are asked to design large-scale systems, such as social
        media platforms or distributed databases.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability, Performance, and Reliability :</strong> The ability to design systems that can
        handle increasing loads and maintain high performance is crucial.</li>
    <li><strong>Trade-offs :</strong> Understanding the trade-offs between different design choices.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Technical Interview Round</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Technical Questions :</strong> In-depth discussions on specific technical topics, such as
        programming languages, databases, operating systems, or networking.</li>
    <li><strong>Problem-Solving :</strong> Solving technical problems using algorithms and data
        structures.</li>
    <li><strong>Debugging and Troubleshooting :</strong> Identifying and fixing errors in code.</li>
</ul>
